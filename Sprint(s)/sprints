Sprint 0: Planning & Setup

    Requirements Elicitation:

        Define user stories (e.g., "As a user, I want to search movies by title," "As a user, I want to filter by genre and year").

    Tooling:

        Set up version control (Git), issue tracking (Jira/Trello), and a repository.

    Environment Setup:

        Prepare your MongoDB server, initialize the backend project, and set up the frontend scaffolding.

Sprint 1: API and Backend Development

    Backend API Endpoints:

        Create endpoints for basic queries (e.g., search by title, filter by genre).

    Database Connection:

        Connect to your MongoDB instance and test simple queries.

    Testing:

        Write unit tests to validate endpoint functionality.

Sprint 2: Frontend Prototype â€“ Basic GUI

    UI Design:

        Create wireframes/mockups for the search interface, results list, and detail view.

    Prototype Components:

        Search Bar: Allows users to type a movie title or keywords.

        Results Section: Displays search results in a list or table.

        Detail Panel: Opens when a movie is selected to show extended information.

    API Integration:

        Connect the frontend components to your backend endpoints using HTTP calls (e.g., with Axios in React).

Sprint 3: Enhancements & Iteration

    Feature Additions:

        Add more filters (e.g., by rating, year, director).

        Implement pagination or infinite scrolling if your dataset is large.

    UI/UX Improvements:

        Refine visual design and responsiveness.

    Feedback Loop:

        Demo the prototype to potential users or team members and iterate based on feedback.

Sprint 4: Testing & Deployment

    Comprehensive Testing:

        Integration and user acceptance testing.

    Final Adjustments:

        Bug fixes, performance improvements, and polishing.

    Deployment:

        Deploy the application and document your process.
